   memory data word.                                                
B. The high and low bytes will be swapped only if both bytes of     
   the memory data word are in the range of hex 00-7F.              
C. The high and low bytes will be swapped only if both bytes of     
   the memory data word are in the range of hex 80-FF.              
D. The high and low bytes will be swapped only if both bytes of     
   the memory data word have the same value.
