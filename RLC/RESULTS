-> We are now analyzing your source code. You will be graded on
the number of instructions you wrote to solve this problem.
The target for the number of executable instructions written is:
 00 -  44 = 20 points 
 45 -  49 = 15 points 
 50 -  54 = 10 points 
 55 -  59 =  5 points 
 60+      =  0 points 
Your actual counts are:

-> Analyzing program documentation. 
The heuristic algorithms used may have problems with your specific code. 
Contact the instructor if you detect a problem with your grade. 
DOCPH-0015 The program header format is adequate. 
DOCHB-0.85 Use of code block headers is adequate. 
DOCLC-0.96 Use of line comments is adequate.

-> Calculating the total grade for the program.                  
This grade is subject to adjustment by the instructor.           
This grade will be reduced by any late submission penalty.
