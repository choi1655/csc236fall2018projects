-> We are now analyzing your source code. You will be graded on
the number of instructions you wrote to solve this problem.
The target for the number of executable instructions written is:
 00 -  30 = 20 points 
 31 -  32 = 15 points 
 33 -  34 = 10 points 
 35 -  36 =  5 points 
 37+      =  0 points 
Your actual counts are:

Directives ..   6    Variables ..   2    Executables ..  48    McCabe ..   7 
++ Grade ++    0 = Points earned for code written efficiency.
